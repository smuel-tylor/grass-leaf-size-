# Developmental and biophysical determinants of grass leaf size worldwide

The two folders shared here present code used by *Baird et al* 
- *Kew*
  -- Multiple regression analysis of a 1752 species dataset of leaf dimensions and average climate across species ranges, including validation based on plotting of residuals

- *LA27*
  -- Demonstration of the approaches used for ANOVA and regression analyses that assessed leaf trait scaling and photosynthetic type comparisons, using the 27 species dataset collected at UCLA, and a matched phylogeny.
